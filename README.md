# Credit-EDA-Project
A Credit EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) project involves analyzing a dataset related to credit risk, such as loan approval or customer credit scores. The goal is to explore and visualize key patterns, correlations, and trends within the data to better understand the factors influencing creditworthiness, helping to make data-driven decisions.
